    This interactive graph visualizes the <i>health status of trees</i> across New York City boroughs using a color-coded map. Each tree is represented as a point, with health categorized into 
    <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Good (Green)</span>, 
    <span style="color: goldenrod; font-weight: bold;">Fair (Yellow)</span>, 
    <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Poor (Red)</span>, and 
    <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Data Not Available (Gray)</span>. 
    Users can explore tree health in specific boroughs using a dropdown menu, view details by hovering over points, and reset to see all boroughs. The graph uses smooth transitions and a clear legend to ensure ease of exploration, providing a deeper understanding of tree health distributions across the city.

    <b>5 .Observations Based on the Visualization:</b><br>
    - The majority of trees are in <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Good Health</span>, reflecting satisfactory tree maintenance and care across most parts of NYC. This indicates that urban tree health is generally well-managed.<br>
    - A smaller but noticeable number of trees are in <span style="color: goldenrod; font-weight: bold;">Fair Health</span>, which suggests some areas may require additional monitoring or care to prevent further decline.<br>
    - Trees in <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Poor Health</span> are sparsely distributed, with no significant clusters visible in any one region. These areas may require targeted intervention to improve tree health.<br>
    - Some regions are marked with <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Data Not Available</span>, indicating gaps in the dataset. This could point to areas where surveys were not conducted or where data collection was incomplete.<br>
    - The <b>interactive features</b> such as the dropdown menu allow users to filter data by borough, making it easier to explore specific regions and compare tree health across different parts of the city.<br>
    - Using the reset button, users can return to a city-wide view, enabling a broader perspective of tree health distribution.<br>
    - Borough-specific insights can be valuable for identifying areas with higher proportions of <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Good Health</span> trees versus areas with more <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Poor Health</span> trees, helping prioritize urban planning efforts.<br>
    - The interactive zoom functionality facilitates detailed exploration of specific clusters, offering precise insights into local tree conditions.<br>
    - Regions with higher proportions of <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Poor Health</span> trees could indicate areas needing immediate attention, while the dominance of <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Good Health</span> trees suggests successful maintenance programs across most regions.
