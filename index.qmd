# Introduction

Trees are essential to urban ecosystems, providing critical benefits such as air purification, temperature regulation, storm-water management, and enhanced biodiversity. Their canopies mitigate the urban heat island effect, reduce energy consumption, and offer habitats for wildlife while improving mental well-being and fostering community cohesion. Recognizing these contributions, this project leverages NYC’s 2015 tree census data, a comprehensive inventory of over 666,000 street trees, to analyze their distribution, health, and impact. The dataset serves as a foundation for assessing the state of the urban forest, identifying areas for improvement, and developing strategies for sustainable urban forestry management.

### Expected Outcomes: Key Areas of Exploration  {.unnumbered}
 
This extensive dataset serves as a critical resource for understanding the composition and condition of New York City's urban forest. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore several key areas:

- **Tree Health and Environmental Impact**:  
  Investigate factors affecting tree health and their relationship to size and location.  

- **Infrastructure Interaction**:  
  Explore the impact of tree placement on sidewalk damage and other infrastructure issues.  

- **Community Engagement**:  
  Assess how Stewardship activities influence tree health and urban forestry.  

- **Urban Planning and Spatial Trends**:  
  Analyze tree distribution and species diversity across boroughs and neighborhoods.  

- **Tree Vulnerability**:  
  Identify common issues affecting tree trunks, branches, and roots, and their locations.  

- **Biodiversity Analysis**:  
  Evaluate the diversity of NYC’s tree population and its implications for urban forestry.  

- **Temporal Insights**:  
  Examine patterns in tree mapping and their significance for urban forest management.  

- **Climate Adaptation**:  
  Determine which tree species are best suited for NYC’s urban environment.  
  
Our project aims to analyze these aspects, leveraging this rich dataset to derive actionable insights for urban forestry management
