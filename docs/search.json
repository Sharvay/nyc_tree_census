    "text": "1 Introduction\nTrees form the backbone of urban ecosystems, offering a multitude of benefits that enhance both environmental quality and human well-being. They act as natural air purifiers, absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen, thereby improving air quality. Their canopies provide shade, mitigating the urban heat island effect and reducing energy consumption by lowering the need for air conditioning. Additionally, trees contribute to storm-water management by intercepting rainfall, reducing runoff, and preventing soil erosion. Beyond their environmental contributions, urban trees enhance the aesthetic appeal of cityscapes, provide habitats for wildlife, and offer recreational spaces that promote mental health and community cohesion.\nRecognizing these benefits, conducting a tree census becomes essential for effective urban forestry management. A comprehensive inventory of street trees allows city planners and environmentalists to assess the current state of the urban forest, identify areas lacking green cover, and develop strategies for planting and maintenance. It also aids in monitoring tree health, detecting diseases or pest infestations early, and ensuring the longevity of the urban canopy. Moreover, data from tree censuses can inform policies aimed at enhancing biodiversity, improving air quality, and adapting to climate change.\nIn 2015, NYC conducted its third Street Tree Census, engaging volunteers in the city’s largest citizen science effort to document over 666,000 trees.This extensive dataset serves as a critical resource for understanding the composition and condition of New York City’s urban forest. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore several key areas:\n\nTree Health and Environmental Impact:\nInvestigate factors affecting tree health and their relationship to size and location.\nInfrastructure Interaction:\nExplore the impact of tree placement on sidewalk damage and other infrastructure issues.\nCommunity Engagement:\nAssess how stewardship activities influence tree health and urban forestry.\nUrban Planning and Spatial Trends:\nAnalyze tree distribution and species diversity across boroughs and neighborhoods.\nTree Vulnerability:\nIdentify common issues affecting tree trunks, branches, and roots, and their locations.\nBiodiversity Analysis:\nEvaluate the diversity of NYC’s tree population and its implications for urban forestry.\nTemporal Insights:\nExamine patterns in tree mapping and their significance for urban forest management.\nClimate Adaptation:\nDetermine which tree species are best suited for NYC’s urban environment.\nOur project aims to analyze these aspects, leveraging this rich dataset to derive actionable insights for urban forestry management",
