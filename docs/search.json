    "text": "1 Introduction\nTrees are essential to urban ecosystems, providing critical benefits such as air purification, temperature regulation, storm-water management, and enhanced biodiversity. Their canopies mitigate the urban heat island effect, reduce energy consumption, and offer habitats for wildlife while improving mental well-being and fostering community cohesion. Recognizing these contributions, this project leverages NYC’s 2015 tree census data, a comprehensive inventory of over 666,000 street trees, to analyze their distribution, health, and impact. The dataset serves as a foundation for assessing the state of the urban forest, identifying areas for improvement, and developing strategies for sustainable urban forestry management.\n\nExpected Outcomes: Key Areas of Exploration\nThis extensive dataset serves as a critical resource for understanding the composition and condition of New York City’s urban forest. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore several key areas:\n\nTree Health and Environmental Impact:\nInvestigate factors affecting tree health and their relationship to size and location.\nInfrastructure Interaction:\nExplore the impact of tree placement on sidewalk damage and other infrastructure issues.\nCommunity Engagement:\nAssess how Stewardship activities influence tree health and urban forestry.\nUrban Planning and Spatial Trends:\nAnalyze tree distribution and species diversity across boroughs and neighborhoods.\nTree Vulnerability:\nIdentify common issues affecting tree trunks, branches, and roots, and their locations.\nBiodiversity Analysis:\nEvaluate the diversity of NYC’s tree population and its implications for urban forestry.\nTemporal Insights:\nExamine patterns in tree mapping and their significance for urban forest management.\nClimate Adaptation:\nDetermine which tree species are best suited for NYC’s urban environment.\n\nOur project aims to analyze these aspects, leveraging this rich dataset to derive actionable insights for urban forestry management",

    "text": "Source : 2015 Street Tree Census - Tree Data\nData Collection :\nThe data was collected by trained volunteers and NYC Parks staff, using standardized protocols to ensure consistency. Each tree’s attributes, including species, diameter, health status, and geographic location, were recorded during the census. The data collection process also involved visual inspections and field surveys to gather accurate information on tree conditions and their interactions with surrounding infrastructure.\nData Format and Structure:\nThe data is presented in a tabular format, with each row representing an individual tree and columns detailing its attributes. Key attributes include:\n\nTree Identification : Unique Tree ID and Block ID for each tree.\n\nSpecies Information : Scientific (Latin) and common names of the tree species.\n\nPhysical Characteristics : Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), health status (Good, Fair, Poor, Dead), and presence of root guards. Assessment of trunk, branch.\nLocation Details : Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), nearest address, borough, and community board.\n\nStewardship and Infrastructure : Level of care provided, sidewalk details, and curb location.\n\nDimensions and Scope:\nThe dataset comprises 666,134 records and 45 columns, each corresponding to an individual street tree. It offers a rich combination of categorical and numerical variables suitable for diverse analytical approaches. Its spatial information enables geospatial analyses, such as examining tree distribution patterns across neighborhoods and boroughs. This richness makes the dataset particularly well-suited for exploratory data analysis, allowing us to uncover trends and insights relevant to urban forestry management.\nFrequency of Update :\nThe dataset is static, representing a one-time snapshot of the NYC street trees as they existed during the census period (2015–2016). It does not receive updates and serves as a historical record.\nImporting the Data :\nThe dataset will be imported using R’s read.csv() function to handle its large size efficiently.",

The data on tree guards might not have been consistently collected, possibly because it was optional or difficult to assess during the survey.\nsteward: At 76% missing values, this column reflects limited data availability on tree stewardship. This may be due to a lack of reporting or complexity in identifying individuals or groups responsible for tree care.\nproblems: This column has 67% missing values. It indicates incomplete data on issues affecting the trees, which could result from challenges in identifying or documenting tree-related problems.\n\nModerate and Low Missing Value Columns\n\nspc_common, spc_latin, health, sidewalk: These columns have around 4.6% missing values. These fields likely had better data collection protocols but still show gaps, potentially due to oversight or difficulty in identifying specific attributes (e.g., species or tree health conditions).\nbbl, bin, census tract, council district: These columns exhibit very low missing values (less than 2%). These administrative or geographic fields were likely easier to document consistently, but small gaps might have occurred due to technical issues or incomplete records.\n\nColumns with No Missing Values\n\nMany columns in the dataset have no missing values, which indicates robust data collection for these fields.

Some values are represented as standard NA in R, while others are explicitly recorded as \"None\". Additionally, there are instances where missing values are represented as blank strings (\"\") or blank spaces (\" \").\nThis inconsistency in representing missing values highlights variations in data collection practices, requiring careful preprocessing to standardize these entries for effective analysis.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Implications\n\nColumns with high missing values (guards, steward, problems) may require imputation or exclusion, depending on their importance in the analysis.\nThe majority of columns with minimal or no missing data indicate that a significant portion of the dataset remains reliable for analysis.\nThe missing data pattern highlights a mix of inconsistencies in data collection efforts, emphasizing the need for preprocessing and careful handling of incomplete information.",

While it contributes to NYC’s fall aesthetics with its dense canopies and abundant leaf shedding, its foliage lacks the vibrant colors of species like red maple and sweetgum, which define the iconic autumn palette. Other species like honeylocust, Callery pear, and pin oak also play significant roles in NYC’s tree population. However, the heavy reliance on the London planetree raises concerns about monoculture vulnerabilities, as pests or diseases could disproportionately affect it. Insights from this analysis suggest that diversifying species further could enhance ecological resilience and reduce maintenance challenges, such as managing the significant cleanup required for London planetree debris.\nThe second bar plot shows that NYC’s least common species, such as red pine, red horse chestnut, and Douglas-fir, have fewer than 30 trees. Their rarity reflects challenges in urban adaptation, including specific environmental needs and sensitivity to pollution. Trees like Osage-orange and Himalayan cedar highlight underutilized biodiversity, offering potential for conservation efforts. Rare species may require tailored strategies for survival in urban environments, such as improved soil preparation, reduced competition, or protection from pests. Incorporating a wider variety of species, including these rarer types, could reduce risks associated with monoculture and promote a more balanced and resilient urban forest.",
