    "text": "1 Introduction\nTrees are essential to urban ecosystems, providing critical benefits such as air purification, temperature regulation, storm-water management, and enhanced biodiversity. Their canopies mitigate the urban heat island effect, reduce energy consumption, and offer habitats for wildlife while improving mental well-being and fostering community cohesion. Recognizing these contributions, this project leverages NYC’s 2015 tree census data, a comprehensive inventory of over 666,000 street trees, to analyze their distribution, health, and impact. The dataset serves as a foundation for assessing the state of the urban forest, identifying areas for improvement, and developing strategies for sustainable urban forestry management.\n\nExpected Outcomes: Key Areas of Exploration\nThis extensive dataset serves as a critical resource for understanding the composition and condition of New York City’s urban forest. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore several key areas:\n\nTree Health and Environmental Impact:\nInvestigate factors affecting tree health and their relationship to size and location.\nInfrastructure Interaction:\nExplore the impact of tree placement on sidewalk damage and other infrastructure issues.\nCommunity Engagement:\nAssess how Stewardship activities influence tree health and urban forestry.\nUrban Planning and Spatial Trends:\nAnalyze tree distribution and species diversity across boroughs and neighborhoods.\nTree Vulnerability:\nIdentify common issues affecting tree trunks, branches, and roots, and their locations.\nBiodiversity Analysis:\nEvaluate the diversity of NYC’s tree population and its implications for urban forestry.\nTemporal Insights:\nExamine patterns in tree mapping and their significance for urban forest management.\nClimate Adaptation:\nDetermine which tree species are best suited for NYC’s urban environment.\n\nOur project aims to analyze these aspects, leveraging this rich dataset to derive actionable insights for urban forestry management",

    "text": "Source : 2015 Street Tree Census - Tree Data\nData Collection :\nThe data was collected by trained volunteers and NYC Parks staff, using standardized protocols to ensure consistency. Each tree’s attributes, including species, diameter, health status, and geographic location, were recorded during the census. The data collection process also involved visual inspections and field surveys to gather accurate information on tree conditions and their interactions with surrounding infrastructure.\nData Format and Structure:\nThe data is presented in a tabular format, with each row representing an individual tree and columns detailing its attributes. Key attributes include:\n\nTree Identification : Unique Tree ID and Block ID for each tree.\n\nSpecies Information : Scientific (Latin) and common names of the tree species.\n\nPhysical Characteristics : Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), health status (Good, Fair, Poor, Dead), and presence of root guards. Assessment of trunk, branch.\nLocation Details : Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), nearest address, borough, and community board.\n\nStewardship and Infrastructure : Level of care provided, sidewalk details, and curb location.\n\nDimensions and Scope:\nThe dataset comprises 166,134 records and 45 columns, each corresponding to an individual street tree. It offers a rich combination of categorical and numerical variables suitable for diverse analytical approaches. Its spatial information enables geospatial analyses, such as examining tree distribution patterns across neighborhoods and boroughs. This richness makes the dataset particularly well-suited for exploratory data analysis, allowing us to uncover trends and insights relevant to urban forestry management.\nFrequency of Update :\nThe dataset is static, representing a one-time snapshot of the NYC street trees as they existed during the census period (2015–2016). It does not receive updates and serves as a historical record.\nImporting the Data :\nThe dataset will be imported using R’s read.csv() function to handle its large size efficiently.",

The data on tree guards might not have been consistently collected, possibly because it was optional or difficult to assess during the survey.\nsteward: At 74.4% missing values, this column reflects limited data availability on tree stewardship.

These fields likely had better data collection protocols but still show gaps, potentially due to oversight or difficulty in identifying specific attributes (e.g., species or tree health conditions).\nbbl, bin, census tract, council district: These columns exhibit very low missing values (less than 2%).

Some values are represented as standard NA in R, while others are explicitly recorded as \"None\". Additionally, there are instances where missing values are represented as blank strings (\"\") or blank spaces (\" \").\nThis inconsistency in representing missing values highlights variations in data collection practices, requiring careful preprocessing to standardize these entries for effective analysis.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Implications\n\nColumns with high missing values (guards, steward, problems) may require imputation or exclusion, depending on their importance in the analysis.\nThe majority of columns with minimal or no missing data indicate that a significant portion of the dataset remains reliable for analysis.\nThe missing data pattern highlights a mix of inconsistencies in data collection efforts, emphasizing the need for preprocessing and careful handling of incomplete information.",

While it contributes to NYC’s fall aesthetics with its dense canopies and abundant shedding, its foliage lacks the vibrant colors that species like red maple and sweetgum display, which define the iconic autumn palette. Other major contributors to NYC’s population are honeylocust, Callery pear, and pin oak. However, the high dependence on one species, the London planetree, does raise concerns of monoculture vulnerabilities as any pest or disease affecting it would result in very uneven damage. These implications indicate that further diversification could improve ecological resilience by reducing the challenges of maintenance, given the immense cleanup required for fallen debris from the London planetree.\nThe second bar plot shows that NYC’s most rare species, including red pine, red horse chestnut, and Douglas-fir, have fewer than 30 trees. These are indicative of the difficult conditions needed for urban adaptation, such as very specific ecological requirements and high sensitivity to pollution. Relatively rare tree species that include Osage-orange and Himalayan-cedar illustrate underutilized biodiversities that can have promise for conservation efforts. Some of these rare species could be assisted to live in an urban environment with improved soil preparation, less competition, or protection from pests. By planting a more diverse set of species, including some of these rare ones, risks from monoculture could be reduced, creating a better balance in the makeup and health of the urban forest.",

This aligns with its popularity as a resilient urban tree, often chosen for its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions.\n\nHealth Trends Across Species:\n\nMost trees across all species and boroughs are in good health (represented by the predominance of green bubbles). However, there are smaller proportions of trees in fair (yellow) or poor (red) health, indicating areas that may require targeted maintenance efforts.\n\nBorough-Specific Characteristics:\n\nManhattan has a noticeably high count of London planetrees in good health, making it a significant contributor to the city’s urban forest. Similarly, Brooklyn and Queens also show a strong presence of Callery pear and Norway maple, with most of these trees in good condition.\nStaten Island, on the other hand, has fewer trees overall, as reflected in the smaller bubble sizes across all species. This could suggest either less dense tree planting efforts or smaller urban areas requiring greenery.\n\nSpecies in Poor Health:\n\nA few instances of trees in poor health, particularly Norway maple in Queens, stand out in the visualization. These trees may require closer attention to improve their condition and ensure they continue contributing positively to the urban ecosystem.\n\nSpecies Diversity:\n\nWhile the London planetree dominates, other species such as Callery pear and honeylocust also have significant representation. This diversity is particularly evident in boroughs like Queens, which seem to have a more balanced mix of species compared to other boroughs.",

This could indicate that while trees without stewardship are at higher risk of deteriorating health, a significant number still maintain good health, potentially due to favorable environmental conditions or maintenance by other means.\nTrees under stewardship levels of “1or2” and “3or4” show similar patterns, with a notable dominance of trees in “Good” health. This suggests that even minimal stewardship efforts play a crucial role in maintaining tree health. However, the diminishing trend in tree count across higher stewardship levels indicates fewer trees fall under intensive care or monitoring (“4orMore”), which might imply resource limitations or a focused approach on only select trees.\nThe log scale representation emphasizes the exponential difference in tree counts across stewardship levels, making it evident that the majority of trees lack any formal stewardship.

    "text": "3.8 Uneven Growth: Tree Diameters and Sidewalk Struggles\nThe plot highlights the interplay between tree placement, sidewalk integrity, and tree health. Proper placement (e.g., OffsetFromCurb) could mitigate sidewalk damage and promote better tree health.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(tree_data, aes(x = sidewalk, y = tree_dbh, fill = sidewalk)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Tree Diameter and Sidewalk Damage\",\n    x = \"Sidewalk Condition\",\n    y = \"Tree Diameter (DBH)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Damage\" = \"#F44336\", \"NoDamage\" = \"#4CAF50\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100)) +  # Adjust the y-axis limits to zoom in\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Tree Diameters\n\nTrees with sidewalk damage have a slightly wider spread of diameters compared to those without damage.\nMost trees in both categories have diameters concentrated in the lower ranges, indicating smaller trees dominate the dataset.\n\nPotential Correlation\n\nSidewalk damage seems slightly more prevalent for trees with larger diameters, as indicated by the broader shape of the violin for “Damage.”\n\nTree Size and Damage\n\nLarger trees might exert more pressure on surrounding sidewalks due to their extensive root systems, contributing to damage.\n\nNoDamage Category\n\nTrees in the “NoDamage” category show a similar diameter distribution, suggesting other factors besides tree size might influence sidewalk integrity.",
