## Description

The "2015 Street Tree Census - Tree Data" dataset is a comprehensive collection of information on New York City's street trees, compiled by the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation in collaboration with volunteers and partner organizations between May 2015 and October 2016. Representing the largest citizen science initiative in the city’s history, the dataset includes detailed attributes for 666,134 recorded trees across New York City's five boroughs.

- **Data Collection** :  
The data was collected by trained volunteers and NYC Parks staff, using standardized protocols to ensure consistency. Each tree’s attributes, including species, diameter, health status, and geographic location, were recorded during the census. The data collection process also involved visual inspections and field surveys to gather accurate information on tree conditions and their interactions with surrounding infrastructure.
  
- **Data Format and Structure**:  
  The data is presented in a tabular format, with each row representing an individual tree and columns detailing its attributes. Key attributes include:

  - *Tree Identification* : Unique Tree ID and Block ID for each tree.  
  - *Species Information* : Scientific (Latin) and common names of the tree species.  
  - *Physical Characteristics* : Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), health status (Good, Fair, Poor, Dead), and presence of root guards. Assessment of trunk, branch.
  - *Location Details* : Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), nearest address, borough, and community board.  
  - *Stewardship and Infrastructure* : Level of care provided, sidewalk details, and curb location.  

- **Dimensions and Scope**:  
  The dataset comprises 666,134 records and 45 columns, each corresponding to an individual street tree. It offers a rich combination of categorical and numerical variables suitable for diverse analytical approaches. Its spatial information enables geospatial analyses, such as examining tree distribution patterns across neighborhoods and boroughs. This richness makes the dataset particularly well-suited for exploratory data analysis, allowing us to uncover trends and insights relevant to urban forestry management.

  
- **Frequency of Update** :  
  The dataset is static, representing a one-time snapshot of the NYC street trees as they existed during the census period (2015–2016). It does not receive updates and serves as a historical record.

- **Import Methodology** :  
  The dataset will be imported using R’s read.csv() function to handle its large size efficiently.
