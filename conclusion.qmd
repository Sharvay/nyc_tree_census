# Conclusion

The NYC Tree Census project offers a comprehensive exploration of the city's urban forest, providing critical insights into the composition, health, and distribution of tree species. By leveraging diverse exploratory data analysis techniques, we have identified key trends and uncovered actionable insights for urban planning, biodiversity, and tree management. 

This project underscores the value of data-informed urban forestry for a sustainable and resilient NYC, providing actionable strategies to enhance the city’s green infrastructure.

This project serves as a blueprint for **data-driven urban forestry management**, enabling policymakers, and city planners to make informed decisions. By leveraging NYC’s vast dataset of tree attributes, we have highlighted opportunities to increase biodiversity, strengthen ecological resilience, and enhance tree health. These insights pave the way for a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future for NYC's urban forest. 

This analysis not only enhances public awareness but also provides a strong foundation for future research and management initiatives. With continued analysis and integration of predictive models, NYC can continue to lead as a pioneer in urban forestry, ensuring the sustainability of its natural ecosystem for generations to come.
